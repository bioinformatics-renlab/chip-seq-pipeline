# chip-seq-pipeline
This is the ChIP-seq mapping pipeline for our lab. The script is still at the very preliminary stage, please let us know how to improve!

## Plans for implementation
At its complete form, this pipeline will include work flow for analysis of (1) a single sample, and (2) replicates using the ENCODE IDR method.

## Roadmap
2017.05.17: Currently we have only the workflow for a single sample. ***And it is not modularized yet***.
